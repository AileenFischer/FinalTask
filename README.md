# fischer_aileen_finaltask
This experiment is borrowed from a learning task, 
which aims to understand how people learn from direct and indirect information as well as from social and nonsocial information. 
In this particular experiment, participants are randomly assigned to 2x2 groups.
They are either assigned to a social condition or to a nonsocial condition and are either presented two rectangles or two triangles.
Depending on the condition, the participants are either presented a green and a blue rectangle or a purple and an orange triangle.
They are instructed to chose one of the rectangles/triangles by pressing keys on the keyboard.
To help them decide, one of the rectangles/triangles is highlighted by a border (red for the rectangle condition, green for the triangle condition).
The social group is told that the highlighted rectangle/triangle represents the most popular choice by past participants
and can either be very helpful or very unhelpful.
The nonsocial group is told that the highlighted rectangle/triangle was chosen by a rigged roulette wheel and can also either be very helpful or very unhelpful.
The aim of the experiment is to find out whether participants differ in their choice-making depending on which group (social or nonsocial) they were assigned to.
